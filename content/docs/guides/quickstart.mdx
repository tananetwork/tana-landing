# Quick Start

This guide will help you deploy your first tana smart contract in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Bun runtime installed
- A terminal/command line

## Installation

Install the tana CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @tana/cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
tana --version
```

## Create Your First Contract

Create a new file called `hello.ts`:

```typescript
// hello.ts
export async function contract() {
  const caller = context.caller()
  return {
    message: `Hello, ${caller.username}!`,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }
}

export async function get(req: Request) {
  return {
    message: "Hello from HTTP GET!"
  }
}
```

## Deploy the Contract

Deploy your contract to the blockchain:

```bash
tana deploy contract hello.ts
```

You'll see output like:

```
✓ Contract deployed successfully
  Contract ID: ctr_abc123
  Owner: usr_youruser
  Block: 42
```

## Test Your Contract

Call your contract:

```bash
tana call ctr_abc123
```

Output:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, youruser!",
  "timestamp": 1699564800000
}
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've deployed your first contract, learn more:

- [CLI Commands](/docs/cli/commands) - Explore all CLI commands
- [API Reference](/docs/api/contracts) - Use the REST API

## Common Issues

### "Command not found: tana"

Make sure you installed the CLI globally with the `-g` flag:

```bash
npm install -g @tana/cli
```

### "No blockchain running"

Start the ledger service:

```bash
tana start
```

This starts all required services on your local machine.
