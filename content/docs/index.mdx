## What is Tana?

Tana is a blockchain platform designed to be **user-owned and operated**. Anyone can start their own blockchain or join existing networks as a validator node. Smart contracts are written in familiar **TypeScript** and executed in a sandboxed V8 environment.

## Key Features

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="TypeScript Contracts" icon="seti:typescript">
    Write smart contracts in TypeScript - no new language to learn. Full type safety and familiar tooling.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Multi-Currency Support" icon="puzzle">
    No native token required. Create and manage any currency directly in your contracts.
  </Card>

  <Card title="CLI-First Design" icon="laptop">
    Everything controllable from the terminal. Deploy, manage, and monitor your blockchain from the command line.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Decentralized Nodes" icon="setting">
    Start your own chain or join existing networks. Full validator node capabilities.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { console } from 'tana/core'

// Simple counter contract
const current = await data.get('counter')
const count = current ? parseInt(current) : 0

await data.set('counter', String(count + 1))
await data.commit()

console.log('Counter:', count + 1)
```

## Architecture Overview

Tana consists of **three compiled binaries** and integrated services:

- **`tana-cli`** - Main user interface built with TypeScript/Bun
- **`tana-runtime`** - Rust-based V8 execution engine for CLI contract execution
- **`tana-edge`** - High-performance HTTP server for off-chain contract APIs
- **Ledger Service** - Integrated blockchain state management

All orchestrated through a simple, powerful CLI:

```bash
# Create a new blockchain
tana new chain my-chain

# Start your chain
tana start

# Deploy a smart contract
tana deploy contract ./my-contract.ts
```

**Status:** Early development - Not production ready

Built with Rust (deno_core), TypeScript, Bun, PostgreSQL, and Astro.
